## About this blog

This is a experimental blog with updates of my life, supplemental to my official homepage: [http://doerlbh.github.io](http://doerlbh.github.io).

I tends to like classifying and arranging everything in order and this style of layouts facilitates that greatly.

In a society of fast speed, ironically a virtual room becomes the most stable place to keep knowledge and thoughts than ever before. 

Thus, I would like to give it a try.

## Acknowledgement

This blog used [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and located in [Github](https://pages.github.com), with a theme modified upon [3-Jekyll](https://github.com/P233/3-Jekyll) and [suyan](https://github.com/suyan/suyan.github.io). Here I really appreciate the wonderful designs and platforms from brilliant authors for above projects.
